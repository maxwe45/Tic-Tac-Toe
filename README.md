# Tic-Tac-Toe
Practice with more Javascript and html/css to create an interactive site with a tic tac toe game. 

Gameplan:
Gameboard can be stored as an array of an array with objects producing a three by three grid model. 
The objects should store the cell name and what fills the square(either x or o or nothing). There should
be a player object with attributes for if they are x or o and winning and a function for them to make their move. There should be an object for the flow of the game but I am not sure yet what exactly should go in it. I believe there should be functions for switching between players and tracking if someone wins (maybe this goes in gameboard).
